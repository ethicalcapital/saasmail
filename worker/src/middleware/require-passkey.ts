/**
 * Refuses requests from session-cookie users who have not registered a passkey.
 *
 * The frontend already redirects unregistered users to /setup-passkey, but that
 * gate is bypassable (curl, devtools). This middleware is the server-side
 * counterpart so passkey registration is actually required to access data.
 *
 * API-key authenticated requests are allowed through: issuance of an API key
 * already requires a passkey (see api-keys-router), so the holder must have
 * had one when the key was minted.
 *
 * Local development is exempt so the dev-mode client-side skip (see App.tsx)
 * doesn't get stopped at the server boundary.
